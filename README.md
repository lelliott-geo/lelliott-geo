- 👋 Hi, I’m @lelliott-geo! I have years of experience collecting, managing, and analyzing data throughout my career as a petroleum geoscientist, business analyst and public health care worker.
- 🌱 Recently I've been upping my game by completing a Springboard Data Science Certification program, consisting of 600 hours of on-line learning and mentoring, and mastering skills in Python, SQL, data analysis, data visualization, hypothesis testing, and machine learning. 
- 💞️ You will find some of my curriculum work here as well as the results of my 2 capstone projects. 
- ✨ Now that I am "certified" as a Data Analyst / Data Scientist I’m using this platform to showcase my work to prospective employers.
- 📫 Enjoy and please provide feedback to me at lauraelliott8671@comcast.net.
